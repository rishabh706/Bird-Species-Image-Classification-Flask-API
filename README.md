# Problem Statement
The problem statement is to classify over 225 different Species of Bird.The purpose it to develop a Deep Learning Model which can classify over 225 different species of Bird.

# Approach Used
Used Transfer Learning pretrained DenseNet201 and Data Augmentation along with GlobalAveragePooling to reduce the no.of trainable Parameters and Overfitting.

# Results Achieved
Achieved an overall accuracy of 97.85% on the Training Set, 95.89% on the validation set and 98.22 percent on the Testing Set.Also Achieved Macro F1 Score,precision and recall of 0.982,0.985 and 0.982
